This is our final project, mineForYou, it is a buying/selling platform for clothes. It stored user data and product data on a database,
each in there own collections. The users posts products and they appear on the main page, ready to be purchased.
The login and registration happen on the same page and passwords are protected with bcryptjs and so are hashed.
Usernames are unique. When a user posts an item, it is added to their user database. Some unfinished aspects are 
the user sales history and the user likes. These were side goals of the project and unfortunately we ran out of
time. However, as each user stores the products they have sold, creating a user history, shouldn't be too
much more work and was agonisingly close to attaining.
